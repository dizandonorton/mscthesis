	abstract = {Phamacokinetics is proposed to study the absorption, the distribution, the biotransformations and the elimination of drugs in man and animals. A single kinetic profile may be well summarized by Cmax, Tmax, t 1/2 and AUC and, having more than one profile, 8 parameters at least, the mean and standard deviation of these parameters, may well summarize the drug kinetics in the whole population. A more carefull description of the data can be obtained interpolating and extrapolating the drug concentrations with some mathematical functions. These functions may be used to reduce all the data in a small set of parameters, or to verify if the hypotheses incorporated in the functions are confirmed by the observations. In the first case, we can say that the task is to get a simulation of the data, in the second to get a model. The functions used to interpolate and reduce the pharmacokinetic data are the multiexponential functions and the reference models are the compartmental models whose solutions are just the multiexponential functions. Using models, new meaningfull pharmacokinetic parameters may be defined which can be used to find relationships between the drug kinetic profile and the physiological process which drive the drug absorption, distribution and elimination. For example, compartmental models allow to define easily the clearance which is dependent on the drug elimination process, or the volume of distribution which depends on the drug distribution in the tissues. Models provide also an easy way to get an estimate of drug absorption after extravasculare drug administration (bioavailability). Model building is a complex multistep process where, experiment by experiment and simulation by simulation, new hypothesis are proven and disproven through a continuous interaction between the experimenter and the computer.},

@article{archetti2010genetic,
	abstract = {Statistical methods, and in particular Machine
	Learning, have been increasingly used in the drug
	development workflow to accelerate the discovery phase
	and to eliminate possible failures early during
	clinical developments. In the past, the authors of this
	paper have been working specifically on two problems:
	(i) prediction of drug induced toxicity and (ii)
	evaluation of the target drug chemical interaction
	based on chemical descriptors. Among the numerous
	existing Machine Learning methods and their application
	to drug development (see for instance [F. Yoshida, J.G.

	edition, Wiley, 1999]), we have been specifically
	concerned with Genetic Programming. A first paper [F.
	Archetti, E. Messina, S. Lanzeni, L. Vanneschi, Genetic
	programming for computational pharmacokinetics in drug
	discovery and development, Genetic Programming and
	Evolvable Machines 8(4) (2007) 17-26
	$\backslash$cite\{Archetti:2007:GPEM\}] has been devoted to problem
	(i). The present contribution aims at developing a
	Genetic Programming based framework on which to build
	specific strategies which are then shown to be a
	valuable tool for problem (ii). In this paper, we use
	target estrogen receptor molecules and genistein based
	drug compounds. Being able to precisely and efficiently
	predict their mutual interaction energy is a very
	important task: for example, it may have an immediate
	relationship with the efficacy of genistein based drugs
	in menopause therapy and also as a natural prevention
	of some tumours. We compare the experimental results
	obtained by Genetic Programming with the ones of a set
	of non-evolutionary Machine Learning methods, including
	Support Vector Machines, Artificial Neural Networks,
	Linear and Least Square Regression. Experimental
	results confirm that Genetic Programming is a promising
	technique from the viewpoint of the accuracy of the
	proposed solutions, of the generalization ability and
	of the correlation between predicted data and correct
	ones.},

		Symbolic regression (SR) is a well studied method in genetic programming (GP) for discovering free-form mathematical models 
		from observed data. However, it has not been widely accepted as a standard data science tool. The reluctance is in part due 
		to the hard to analyze random nature of GP and scalability issues. On the other hand, most popular deterministic regression 
		algorithms were designed to generate linear models and therefore lack the flexibility of GP based SR (GP-SR). Our hypothesis 
		is that hybridizing these two techniques will create a synergy between the GP-SR and deterministic approaches to machine 
		learning, which might help bring the GP based techniques closer to the realm of big learning. In this paper, we show that 
		a hybrid deterministic/GP-SR algorithm outperforms GP-SR alone and the state-of-the-art deterministic regression technique 
		alone on a set of multivariate polynomial symbolic regression tasks as the system to be modeled becomes more multivariate.

		In a recent contribution we have introduced a new implementation of geometric semantic operators for Genetic Programming. 
		Thanks to this implementation, we are now able to deeply investigate their usefulness and study their properties on complex 
		real-life applications. Our experiments confirm that these operators are more effective than traditional ones in optimizing 
		training data, due to the fact that they induce a unimodal fitness landscape. Furthermore, they automatically limit 
		overfitting, something we had already noticed in our recent contribution, and that is further discussed here. Finally,
		we investigate the influence of some parameters on the effectiveness of these operators, and we show that tuning their 
		values and setting them “a priori” may be wasted effort. Instead, if we randomly modify the values of those parameters 
		several times during the evolution, we obtain a performance that is comparable with the one obtained with the best setting, 
		both on training and test data for all the studied problems.

		Traditional Genetic Programming (GP) searches the space of functions/programs by using search operators that manipulate 
		their syntactic representation, regardless of their actual semantics/behaviour. Recently, semantically aware search 
		operators have been shown to outperform purely syntactic operators. In this work, using a formal geometric view on 
		search operators and representations, we bring the semantic approach to its extreme consequences and introduce a novel 
		form of GP – Geometric Semantic GP (GSGP) – that searches directly the space of the underlying semantics of the programs. 
		This perspective provides new insights on the relation between program syntax and semantics, search operators and fitness 
		landscape, and allows for principled formal design of semantic search operators for different classes of problems. 
		We derive specific forms of GSGP for a number of classic GP domains and experimentally demonstrate their superiority to 
		conventional operators.
